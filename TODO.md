Database publishing issue
currently the users.db and anime-dimension.db files are included in the dotnet publish output, but the users.db file is a dev file and should not be published to production, the anime-dimension.db file is intended to be generated by the Database Orchestrator and should then be published to production, but in some cases the db file may not be present,
but the deployment too auto removes all old files from the server before copying the new files, so if the db files are not present in the publish output, they will be deleted from the server and the api will not work.
add exceptions to the deployment tool, keeping the users db file
